						<p className="media__description">
							<i>Interlude</i> begins like a Baroque trio sonata with duetting counterpoint, an
							indenpendent bass, and with chords at the centre of the texture; then the music fades
							away in a calm passage of wide harmonies sustained by trills.

							These two pieces were conceived as a pair, and composed in December 2020 and January

							different kinds of music performed at the same time.

							Performed by Terence Allbright on 30th November 2021, at Chichester University.
