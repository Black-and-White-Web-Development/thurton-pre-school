				Terence Allbright was born in Northampton, where he taught himself to play the piano and to
				compose. He became a teenage organist and choirmaster, then studied piano and composition in
				London and at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he was Organ Scholar.
			</p>
			<p className="biography__paragraph">
				Terence was Piano Adviser to the now-extinct Inner London Education Authority and joint Head
				of Piano at the Authority&apos;s Centre for Young Musicians; as well as an enjoyable stint
				in a soap factory and a less enjoyable spell as a hotel night porter, he has taught at
				Coventry Music School, at Seaford College and at Chichester College, and was Artistic
				Director of the Petworth Festival for eight years.
			</p>
			<p className="biography__paragraph">
				His solo performances include repertoire from the 16th century to the present, and he has
				twice performed all 53 pieces in Raynaldo Hahn&apos;s <i>Le Rossignol Eperdu</i> – a feat
				which the Reynaldo Hahn Association director called, &quot;a marathon and a world
				first&quot;. Terence has played in Mexico and Paris, all over South-East Asia, and in The
				Long Room at Lord&apos;s, with mezzo-soprano Ann Murray, with baritone Stephen Roberts, and
				with Chinese soprano Violet Chang.
			</p>
			<p className="biography__paragraph">
				He has very fortunate in his song recital partners who have also included sopranos Felicity
				Lott, Jane Manning and Jacquelyn Fugelle; mezzo Susan Legg, tenors Andrew Wicks and Neil
				Jenkins and Phillip Langridge, and baritones Giles White and Michael Pearce. He has given
				many programmes of words and music – especially with actor-readers Gabriel Woolf, Susan
				Jameson and Simon Brett; and a favourite platform partner for many years was the late Jill
				Balcon.
			</p>
			<p className="biography__paragraph">
				The British Music Society&apos;s review of Terence&apos;s recording with Stephen Roberts of
				Somervell&apos;s <i>Maud</i> cycle declared, “Allbright&apos;s pianism is superb
				throughout”, and in a Daily Telegraph review of a Schumann song recital at Cadogan Hall Ivan
				Hewitt said, “it was the beautiful way accompanist Terence Allbright played the tiny,
				pregnant postlude to each song that made the experience truly profound”. He has given many
				concerts of chamber music, especially with strings, but most recently with trumpeter Fraser
				Tannock and in piano & organ programmes with Timothy Ravalde.
			</p>
			<p className="biography__paragraph">
				Among his early compositions are about 50 scores for BBC Radio Drama, but a prolonged bout
				of composer&apos;s block led him to discard everything up to 1988 and to begin again. Recent
				works include <i>...isms</i> for piano, two <i>Trios</i> for violin, cello & piano,{" "}
				<i>Manga</i> for bass clarinet & piano, and <i>Snapshots</i> for ensemble. He is currently
				working on <i>Wondrous Machine</i> – a set of toccatas for organ – and{" "}
				<i>Everything starts with a Dot</i> for ensemble.
